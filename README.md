# SpotfireDockerScripts
These directories include scripts for working with TIBCO Spotfire components in a Docker environment.  They are initial scripts tested within a non-enterprise environment.  

The purpose of this information is to help one get started with using TIBCO Spotfire Server and TIBCO Spotfire Node Manager with Docker Containers.  The Docker and Spotfire Server software may change overtime.  The testing in this document was done with Spotfire version 7.11 and Docker engine version 18.06.1 on Windows.  The Spotfire install scripts likely will not change much between versions, but one should be aware of this possibility.

Please see the TIBCO Community article for more information - [TIBCO Spotfire Server Docker Scripts](https://community.tibco.com/wiki/tibco-spotfirer-server-docker-scripts)
